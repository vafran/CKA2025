# Congratulations!

You have successfully completed the scenario. You have learned how to:

-   Inspect an existing Kubernetes Ingress resource.
-   Create Gateway API resources (`Gateway` and `HTTPRoute`) to replicate the same routing logic.
-   Replace the old Ingress resource with the new, more flexible Gateway API configuration.

This process is a fundamental step in adopting modern Kubernetes networking best practices. Great job!
