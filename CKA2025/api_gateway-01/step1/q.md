Your goal is to replace the `nginx-ingress` with the equivalent Gateway API resources.

1.  **Create a `Gateway` resource named `nginx-gateway`.**  
    Use the provided `nginx-gateway-class`. This resource represents the entry point for traffic.

2.  **Create an `HTTPRoute` resource named `nginx-httproute`.**  
    Attach the `HTTPRoute` to your new `nginx-gateway`.  
    Define a rule that matches all traffic (`/`) and routes it to the `nginx-service` on port `80`.

3.  **Delete the old Ingress resource (`nginx-ingress`).**  
    Once the Gateway API is configured and traffic is flowing, you can remove the `nginx-ingress`.

You can check if the new setup is working by using `curl` on the Gateway's public IP address.

Once you have completed these steps, your environment will be validated.

**Gateway resource (`nginx-gateway.yaml`):**
```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: nginx-gateway
spec:
  gatewayClassName: nginx-gateway-class
  listeners:
    - name: http
      protocol: HTTP
      port: 80
```

**HTTPRoute resource (`nginx-httproute.yaml`):**
```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: nginx-httproute
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: nginx-gateway
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /
      backendRefs:
        - name: nginx-service
          port: 80
```

**Apply the new resources:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-gateway.yaml
kubectl apply -f nginx-httproute.yaml
```

**Delete the old Ingress:**
```bash
kubectl delete ingress nginx-ingress
```
